        <h3>The Peripheral <br> 2014</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">
          Where Flynne and her brother, Burton, live, jobs outside the drug
          business are rare. Fortunately, Burton has his veteran’s benefits, for
          neural damage he suffered from implants during his time in the USMC’s
          elite Haptic Recon force. Then one night Burton has to go out, but
          there’s a job he’s supposed to do—a job Flynne didn’t know he had.
          Beta-testing part of a new game, he tells her. The job seems to be
          simple: work a perimeter around the image of a tower building. Little
          buglike things turn up. He’s supposed to get in their way, edge them
          back. That’s all there is to it. He’s offering Flynne a good price to 
          take over for him. What she sees, though, isn’t what Burton told her
          to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder.</p>

          <h3>Distrust That Particular Flavor <br> 2012</h3>
          <p class="synopsis">
            William Gibson is known primarily as a novelist, with his work ranging
            from his groundbreaking first novel, Neuromancer, to his more recent
            contemporary bestsellers Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, and Zero
            History. During those nearly thirty years, though, Gibson has been
            sought out by widely varying publications for his insights into
            contemporary culture. Wired magazine sent him to Singapore to report
            on one of the world’s most buttoned-up states. The New York Times
            Magazine asked him to describe what was wrong with the Internet.
            Rolling Stone published his essay on the ways our lives are all
            “soundtracked” by the music and the culture around us. And in a speech
            at the 2010 Book Expo, he memorably described the interactive
            relationship between writer and reader.</p>

        <h3>Zero History <br> 2010</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">
          Hollis Henry worked for the global marketing magnate Hubertus Bigend
          once before. She never meant to repeat the experience. But she’s
          broke, and Bigend never feels it’s beneath him to use whatever power
          comes his way -- in this case, the power of money to bring Hollis onto
          his team again. Not that she knows what the “team” is up to, not at
          first.
          Milgrim is even more thoroughly owned by Bigend. He’s worth owning for
          his useful gift of seeming to disappear in almost any setting, and his
          Russian is perfectly idiomatic – so much so that he spoke Russian with
          his therapist, in the secret Swiss clinic where Bigend paid for him to
          be cured of the addiction that would have killed him.
          Garreth has a passion for extreme sports. Most recently he jumped off
          the highest building in the world, opening his chute at the last
          moment, and he has a new thighbone made of rattan baked into bone,
          entirely experimental, to show for it. Garreth isn’t owned by Bigend
          at all. Garreth has friends from whom he can call in the kinds of
          favors that a man like Bigend will find he needs, when things go
          unexpectedly sideways, in a world a man like Bigend is accustomed to
          controlling.
          As when a Department of Defense contract for combat-wear turns out to
          be the gateway drug for arms dealers so shadowy that even Bigend,
          whose subtlety and power in the private sector would be hard to
          overstate, finds himself outmaneuvered and adrift in a seriously
          dangerous world.</p>

        <h3>Spook Country <br> 2007</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">
          Tito is in his early twenties. Born in Cuba, he speaks fluent Russian,
          lives in one room in a NoLita warehouse, and does delicate jobs
          involving information transfer.
          Hollis Henry is an investigative journalist, on assignment from a
          magazine called Node. Node doesn't exist yet, which is fine; she's
          used to that. But it seems to be actively blocking the kind of buzz
          that magazines normally cultivate before they start up. Really
          actively blocking it. It's odd, even a little scary, if Hollis lets
          herself think about it much. Which she doesn't; she can't afford to.
          Milgrim is a junkie. A high-end junkie, hooked on prescription
          antianxiety drugs. Milgrim figures he wouldn't survive twenty-four
          hours if Brown, the mystery man who saved him from a misunderstanding
          with his dealer, ever stopped supplying those little bubble packs.
          What exactly Brown is up to Milgrim can't say, but it seems to be
          military in nature. At least, Milgrim's very nuanced Russian would
          seem to be a big part of it, as would breaking into locked rooms.
          Bobby Chombo is a "producer," and an enigma. In his day job, Bobby is
          a troubleshooter for manufacturers of military navigation equipment.
          He refuses to sleep in the same place twice. He meets no one. Hollis
          Henry has been told to find him.</p>

        <p class="synopsis">
          Cayce Pollard is an expensive, spookily intuitive market-research
          consultant. In London on a job, she is offered a secret assignment: to
          investigate some intriguing snippets of video that have been appearing
          on the Internet. An entire subculture of people is obsessed with these
          bits of footage, and anybody who can create that kind of brand loyalty
          would be a gold mine for Cayce's client. But when her borrowed
          apartment is burgled and her computer hacked, she realizes there's
          more to this project than she had expected. </p>

        <h3>All Tomorrow's Parties <br> 1999</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">
          All Tomorrow's Parties is the perfect novel to publish at the end of
          the 20th century. It brings back Colin Laney, one of the most popular
          characters from Idoru, the man whose special sensitivities about
          people and events let him predict certain aspects of the future. Laney
          has realized that the disruptions everyone expected to happen at the
          beginning of the year 2000, which in fact did not happen, are still to
          come. Though down-and-out in Tokyo, his sense of what is to come tells
          him that the big event, whatever it is, will happen in San Francisco. 
          He decides to head back to the United States--to San Francisco--to
          meet the future. </p>

          When Rez, the lead singer for the rock band Lo/Rez is rumored to be
          engaged to an "idoru" or "idol singer"--an artificial celebrity
          creation of information software agents--14-year-old Chia Pet McKenzie
          is sent by the band's fan club to Tokyo to uncover the facts. At the
          same time, Colin Laney, a data specialist for Slitscan television,
          uncovers and publicizes a network scandal. He flees to Tokyo to escape
          the network's wrath. As Chia struggles to find the truth, Colin
          struggles to preserve it, in a futuristic society so media-saturated
          that only computers hold the hope for imagination, hope and
          spirituality.</p>

        <h3>Count Zero <br> 1986</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">
          Turner, corporate mercenary, wakes in a reconstructed body, a
          beautiful woman by his side. Then Hosaka Corporation reactivates him
          for a mission more dangerous than the one he's recovering from: MaasNeotek's chief of R&D is defecting. Turner is the one assigned to get
          him out intact, along with the biochip he's perfected. But this proves
          to be of supreme interest to certain other parties--some of whom
          aren't remotely human.
          Bobby Newmark is entirely human: a rustbelt data-hustler totally
          unprepared for what comes his way when the defection triggers war in
          cyberspace. With voodoo on the Net and a price on his head, Newmark
          thinks he's only trying to get out alive. A stylish, streetsmart,
          frighteningly probable parable of the future and sequel to
          Neuromancer. </p>
